## Installing the GUI for PostgreSQL ##

## Won't Lie I struggled alot installing this tool but I figured out a way ##

## Run the following commands ##

## Adding public key ##
curl https://www.pgadmin.org/static/packages_pgadmin_org.pub | sudo apt-key add

## Creating repository ##
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/pgadmin/pgadmin4/apt/$(lsb_release -cs) pgadmin4 main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgadmin4.list && apt update'

## Install ##

sup apt update

Sudo apt install pgadmin4-web

## Configure ##
sudo /usr/pgadmin4/bin/setup-web.sh

## After running this command I get the following error ##

System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate.
Failed to connect to bus: Host is down
Error restarting apache2. Please check the systemd logs

## Work around ##

sudo aervice apache2 restart

## After running the above command go to http://localhost/pg4admin and you should be good to go ##
